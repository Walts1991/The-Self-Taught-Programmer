#There are 4 rules with naming variables
#1. Variables cannot have spaces - use underscores (_)
#2. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers and the underscore (_) symbol
#3. You cannot start a variable name with a number but can start a name with an underscore (_)
#4. You cannot use Python keywords for variable names.  You can find a list of keywords at http://theselftaughtprogrammer.io/keywords
